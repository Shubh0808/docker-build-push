# Flask Dockerized Application

This project contains a simple Flask application that is Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability. It showcases how to build, containerize, and push a Python-based Flask application to Docker Hub. The application is built using the Python 3.9-slim Docker image, and it listens on port 5000 for HTTP requests.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following:

* **Dockerizing a Flask Application**: The Flask app is containerized using Docker, allowing it to run in any environment that supports Docker.
* **Building a Docker Image**: The Docker image is created using a `Dockerfile` that specifies the application's dependencies and configuration.
* **Pushing to Docker Hub**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, enabling easy access for deployment on various platforms.
* **Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions are used to automatically build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Features

* **Flask Web App**: A simple Flask app with an example endpoint.
* **Dockerized Environment**: Fully containerized with a Python runtime, application dependencies, and configuration.
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated Docker image builds and deployments.

## Application Structure

The application follows a simple directory structure:

* **Dockerfile**: Defines the steps to build the Docker image.
* **app.py**: Contains the main Flask application code.
* **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary Python packages for the Flask app to run.
* **.dockerignore**: Specifies files and directories that should not be included in the Docker image.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Build the Docker image**: Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
3. **Run the application**: Start the Docker container and access the Flask app via your browser.

For detailed instructions on setting up the project and deploying it, refer to the specific commands and setup instructions within the repository.

## Technologies Used

* **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building the web application.
* **Docker**: For containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
* **GitHub Actions**: For automating the build and deployment process to Docker Hub.
